Architecture**\n=====================================\n\nThe repository is structured into the following high-level components:\n\n### **Data**\n----------------\n\n* **Input**: The repository expects a PDF file as input, which is processed to extract the Top-10 most significant arguments.\n* **Output**: The processed results are exported in both JSON and PowerPoint formats.\n\n### **Model**\n------------\n\n* **Transformer Summarizer**: Utilizes the `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model for summarization.\n* **Sentence-BERT**: Employs the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for embeddings.\n* **TextRank**: Uses a cosine similarity graph for importance ranking.\n* **Stance Detection**: Leverages the `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model for zero-shot classification.\n\n### **Utils**\n------------\n\n* **PDF Extraction**: Utilizes PyMuPDF and OCR fallback via Tesseract for PDF extraction.\n* **Sentence Tokenization**: Employs NLTK for sentence tokenization.\n* **Clustering**: Applies Agglomerative Clustering to group arguments.\n\n### **Pipeline**\n--------------\n\nThe pipeline is composed of the following steps:\n\n1. **PDF Extraction**: Extracts the text from the input PDF file.\n2. **Sentence Tokenization**: Tokenizes the extracted text into individual sentences.\n3. **Embeddings**: Computes embeddings for each sentence using Sentence-BERT.\n4. **Importance Ranking**: Ranks the sentences based on their importance using TextRank.\n5. **Stance Detection**: Classifies the stance of each sentence using zero-shot classification.\n6. **Clustering**: Groups the sentences into clusters based on their similarity.\n7. **Summarization**: Generates a concise summary for each cluster using the transformer summarizer.\n8. **Export Results**: Exports the processed results in both JSON and PowerPoint formats.\n\n### **Notebooks**\n----------------\n\n* **`amicus_top10_colab.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that implements the pipeline and exports the results in both JSON and PowerPoint formats.\n\n### **Requirements**\n------------------\n\n* **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists the required dependencies for the project.\n\n### **Miscellaneous**\n-------------------\n\n* **`s1.png`**, **`s2.png`**, **`s3.png`**: Image files that are likely used for visualization or documentation purposes.\n* **`top10.json`**: A JSON file that contains the processed results.\n* **`final_analysis_with_top10.pptx`**: A PowerPoint file that contains the final analysis with the Top-10 most significant arguments.\n\n## File
